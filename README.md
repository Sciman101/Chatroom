# Chatroom
A simple LAN Chatroom made in Java and Swing

## What and Why?

This was my final project for my computer science course in high school. It's fairly bare bones as far as chat clients go, but it works well enough and was a good introduction to some networking concepts

## How to use

Download and compile ChatroomServer.java and ChatroomClient.java. The client can connect to the server so long as they're on the same local area network. If you want to name your server, run it with the name as the first parameter (i.e. java ChatroomServer ServerName)

## Privacy

At the time of writing this I know next to nothing about encryption and privacy protocols. This application is meant to be used for educational purposes, and I can't guarentee the safety of your information if you choose to use it in any capacity greater than that.
